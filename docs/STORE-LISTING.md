# Chrome Web Store submission material (§12)

> **Published:** https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/outdegree/kjmjfehjgbcgibkbekgacfgibfmglmod
> — this doc is kept for reference and for future listing updates.

Everything an agent/maintainer needs to fill the Web Store listing for the
**Outdegree** extension. The architecture makes the privacy story
*verifiable*, which de-risks the (stricter-than-usual) review that any
browsing-data extension receives.

## Naming (§12.5)

- **Name:** **Outdegree** — used everywhere (repo, manifest, and Store display
  title). Unique and brandable.
- **Store display title:** **Outdegree — a local-only map of how you browse.**
  (Must not contain "Chrome" or imply Google endorsement; the store does not
  enforce title uniqueness.)

## Single purpose (§12.4)

> Visualize your own web-browsing history as an interactive, local-only
> navigation graph.

## Short / detailed description (§12.6)

Lead both with **"100% local · no network · open source."**

> **Outdegree** turns your browsing history into an interactive directed
> graph you can explore over time — by session, day, week, month, or year. See
> which sites you move between, which are hubs, and how you got there (link,
> search, typed, form), or follow a single session as a left-to-right flow.
> Pan, zoom, drag nodes to arrange, and search. Everything is processed and
> stored **locally on your device**; the extension makes **no network requests**
> and cannot read page content. Open source.

## Per-permission justifications (§12.3)

- **`webNavigation`** — "Observes page-navigation events to record which sites
  you visit and how you move between them. Reads navigation metadata only (URL,
  navigation type); does not read or access page content."
- **`storage` / `unlimitedStorage`** — "Stores your navigation graph locally on
  your device. `unlimitedStorage` allows a long history (months to a year)
  without hitting the default quota. Nothing is transmitted off-device."
- **No host permissions** — call out as a feature: the extension cannot read
  page content or contact any server.

## Data-practices disclosures (§12.4)

- **Data collected by the developer:** none. Browsing activity is processed
  **locally** and never transmitted to the developer or anyone else.
- Certifications:
  - **Not sold or transferred** to third parties.
  - **Not used** for purposes unrelated to the single purpose.
  - **Not used** for creditworthiness or lending.
  - The "web history / user activity" category is **handled locally**, not
    *collected*.

## Listing logistics (§12.6)

- One-time **$5** developer registration fee.
- Assets: icons (16/32/48/128 — see `extension/icons/`), **≥1 screenshot** (the
  dashboard graph is the hero shot), short + detailed descriptions.
- Expect a **slower, stricter review** due to the browsing-data profile; the
  enforced local-only guarantee is what de-risks it.
- Privacy policy: hosted via GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys
  `docs/`). One-time setup: repo **Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"**.
  Once enabled the policy is at
  `https://erovelli.github.io/Outdegree/privacy-policy.html` — link that in the
  listing.

## Pre-submit checklist (§12.7)

- [x] Build the **packed/production** extension (`./build.sh`) — verified the
      dashboard WASM is instantiated **from inlined bytes**, so it works under
      the production CSP (no fetch of the wasm; `connect-src 'none'` cannot block
      instantiation).
- [x] Confirm `connect-src 'none'` breaks nothing — there are no intended
      network calls; export is a local `Blob` download, not a `connect`.
- [x] **Grep the built bundle** for network surface — `fetch`,
      `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, `EventSource`, `navigator.sendBeacon`,
      `https://`/`http://`, dynamic `import()`, `importScripts`: **all zero** in
      `dist/` (Vite modulepreload polyfill disabled; wasm-bindgen fetch
      self-loader neutralized).
- [x] Confirm `psl` uses the embedded list (no runtime fetch) and the UI runs in
      CSR (the DOM is built at runtime; no hydration callback).
- [x] Privacy policy hosted via GitHub Pages (`pages.yml`) — enable Pages
      (Settings → Pages → GitHub Actions), then link
      `https://erovelli.github.io/Outdegree/privacy-policy.html`. Form copy above
      filled in.
- [x] `"incognito": "not_allowed"` present; `host_permissions: []`; CSP includes
      `connect-src 'none'` (verified in `dist/manifest.json`).

Re-run the bundle audit any time with:

```bash
./build.sh
grep -rIoE "fetch\(|XMLHttpRequest|WebSocket|EventSource|sendBeacon|https?://" dist
# (expected: no matches)
```
